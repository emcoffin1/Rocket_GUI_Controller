add test guis to the test combobox
    refer to previous program

add a setting to the time function where if i'm running real data but not firing then it'll just keep updating
without the time updating, aka show values but no change in time
    only update time during firing

dynamically adjust model as splitter moves



### Using graph updater
- Add graphs to list
- Add data controller listener self.data_controller.data-signal.connect(self.update_graphs)
